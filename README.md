This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Dojo 2 including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Dojo 2 community style guides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repository
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the [local server](http://localhost:9999) with watch and hot reload

The local web server uses port 9999.

For a production build of the application:
